# Rockfish Game

### Background
Rockfish Game is a modification of an original game created by [Mark Syphus](https://github.com/msyphus) as part of a project called [Rockfish Conservation](https://rockfish-conservation.herokuapp.com/). The original game is called Fish Finder and can be played [here](https://msyphus.github.io/fish-finder/).

### Purpose
 Rockfish are a family of important commercial and game fish that are being overfished.  Several species are endangered or threatened.  They live deep so they often experience barotrauma when they are caught, which severely hinders the ability to safely release them.  They also have a long life span and slow maturity.  In short, these fish are slow to reproduce, but can easily be wiped out. 
 
 Several agencies invest a lot of money into conservation and awareness efforts. An important part of awareness is to educate the fishing community about species identification (and safe catch-and-release methods) so they can release the species that are most vulnerable. This is difficult, however, since many rockfish species look alike.
 
The purpose of Rockfish Game is to provide a fun way to learn and identify the different species of rockfish and their current conservation status. The link to the game is included in a project called [Rockfish Conservation](https://rockfish-conservation.herokuapp.com/) to further enhance the education of rockfish conservation efforts. You can view the Rockfish Conservation repo [here](https://github.com/cftgithub/rockfish-conservation). 

### How To Play
To play the game, simply click on a fish image. On each click, a message will pop up, displaying the name and the conservation status of the fish image that is being clicked. A different point value is assigned to each conservation status ("Good", "Unknown", "Vulnerable", "Threatened", "Endangered"). Clicking rockfish on the "Good" status earns the most point value. Clicking on a "Threatened" species does not increase your score. Clicking on an "Endangered" species ends the game and the player loses all points earned.
